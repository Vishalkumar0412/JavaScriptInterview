# What is the diffrece b/w null and undefined 
 when a variable declare but not asign any value it is automaticaly asign ***undefined*** 
 ```js
 let undefinedVarible;
 console.log(undefiedVariable)// undefined 
```

- We use undefined when we don't have value right now we will get after some logic and operations

### Null is the variable that intentionaly asign the null value
```js
    let nullVariable= null;
    console.log(nullVaribale) // null
```

- null is used when you are sure you do not have any value of the particular variable
