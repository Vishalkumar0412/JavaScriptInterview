# What is the diffrece bw while loop and for loop
 ## for loop
 1. `for` loop allow to iterate a block of code for specific number of time
 2. `for` loop is better for condition with initialization and with increment because all can be set one line of code 
 ## while loop 
1. `while` loop executes a block of code while a certain condition is true
2. `while` loop is better when there is only codition, no initialization no increment
