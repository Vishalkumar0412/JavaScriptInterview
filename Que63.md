# Q. What is the difference between an array and an object?

**Comparison Table:**

| Arrays                              | Objects                              |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1. Arrays are collection of values. | Objects are collections of key-value pairs. |
| 2. Arrays are denoted by square brackets `[ ]`. | Objects are denoted by curly braces `{ }`. |
| 3. Elements in array are ordered.   | Properties in objects are unordered. |

**Code Examples:**

**Array:**
```javascript
// Array
var fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
// Object
var person = {
    name: "Amit",
    age: 25,
    city: "Delhi"
};
