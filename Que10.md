# What is a Loop and Types of Loops in JavaScript

A loop in JavaScript is a control structure that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is met.

**Types of Loops**:

1. **for Loop**  
   - Repeats code a specific number of times using a counter.  
   - Syntax:  
     ```javascript
     for (initialization; condition; increment) {
       // code
     }

# Definitions of Loops in JavaScript

1. **for Loop**  
   - A loop that repeats a block of code a fixed number of times, using an initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.

2. **while Loop**  
   - A loop that continues executing a block of code as long as a specified condition remains `true`.
     ```js
         while (condition) {
         // code
            }
     ```
3. **do...while Loop**  
   - A loop that executes a block of code at least once, then repeats as long as a condition is `true`.
    ```js
        do {
          // code
        } while (condition);
    ```
4. **for...in Loop**  
   - A loop that iterates over the enumerable properties (keys) of an object.
   ```js
               for (key in object) {
              // code
            }
   ```

5. **for...of Loop**  
   - A loop that iterates over the values of an iterable object, such as arrays or strings.


   ```js
        for (variable of iterable) {
          // code
        }  
    ```
