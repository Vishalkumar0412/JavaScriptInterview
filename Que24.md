# Q.24 What is the difference between unary, binary, and ternary operators?

**Header:**
Operators based on number of operands

**Unary Operator:**
```javascript
let a = 5;

// Unary operator
// Single operand
let b = -a;
console.log(b);
// Output: -5

console.log(++a);
// Output: 6
```

**Binary Operator:**
```js
let x = 10;
let y = 3;

// Binary operator
// Two operands
let z = x + y;
console.log(z);
// Output: 13
```

**Ternary Operator:**
```js
// Ternary operator
// Three operands
let result = condition ? 'Yes' : 'No';
console.log(result);
// Output: 'Yes'
```
