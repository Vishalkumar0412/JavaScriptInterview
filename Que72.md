# Q. What is the difference between Map and Object in JS?

**Comparison Table:**

| Map                                   | Javascript Object                     |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| 1. Keys in a Map can be of any data type, including strings, numbers, objects, functions etc. | Keys in a regular Javascript object are limited to strings and symbols. |
| 2. A Map maintains the order of key-value pairs as they were inserted. | In a regular object, there is no guaranteed order of keys. |
| 3. Useful when keys are of different types, insertion order is important. | Useful when keys are strings or symbols and there are simple set of properties. |
